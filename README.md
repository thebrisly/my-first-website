Where the magic happens

As I've been wanting to learn how to create a website with three.js for a year now but I know absolutely nothing about hosting and all that shit about servers and all the things related to creating a simple website (html, css, javascript, etc.) I finally decided to try

You can follow, if you want, the progress of my first website. I will also put a textual description (the theory) of how to do it so you can do it from scratch by yourself

I will try to understand what is html, css javascript and try to code something minimalist with a library that fascinates me: three.js

let's try


<h1> First steps into website coding </h1>

<p> After a minute of research, all the base of a website is made thanks to an HTML file. Then a CSS file to make it more beautiful. And finally with javascript files to make your site more interactive  </p>

<p> HTML and CSS are very related, but they don't work in the same way. HTML is the skeleton of a website and CSS is the skin, the hair and everything else that is pretty (even if a skeleton is also very beautiful). </p>

<h2> HTML </h2>

- There are several "versions" of HTML. That's why at the beginning of each .html file you have to define which "version" you are using so that the computer interprets it in the right way: !DOCTYPE html 

- Then any file must start and end with the html /html tag so we know which part of the code is html.

- Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the "head" of the page.

- Anchor tags ("a") are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.
- Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: "!-- comment --"
