    <h1> About Brisly </h1>
    <p> My life is a bit of chaos - I love too many things to focus on just one thing. And since a day has 24 hours, it gives me time to do everything I've ever wanted to do! 
     <br> <strong>Life is meant to be enjoyed to the fullest</strong>, right?</p>
     <p> These are the main subjects that embellish my life : </p>
    <h2> Sport </h2>
    <h2> Coding </h2>
    <h2> Blockchain </h2>
    <h2> Creativity </h2>
    <h2> Travel </h2>
    <h2> Challenges </h2>
